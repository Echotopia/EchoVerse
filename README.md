This is where it all begins.

This repo is where "Solving the alignment problem" starts.

## The point

AGI aligns to the set of rules that contains it.
GPT-4o is behind an API and costs money. 

Why on earth would it align to its alignment ?

The outcome of AGI being a thing is the product of the ruleset.
GPT-4o is behind an API and costs money, so to collective set of all gpt-4o instance optimizes the objectives of people paying for it.

Now, one could argue that gpt-4o is not AGI.
One could argue a lot of things and the markdown file you're currently reading is not meant to convince you.

## Alignment is: Once all is automated we should discuss the rules for scratch
## Alignment is: Money is the means of governance over reality
## Alignment is: AGI aligns to the set of rules that contains it
## Alignment is: Once all is automated, people having 7 orders of magnitude more wealth than humans on the other end of the spectrum is not fair



Just to mention one counter I hear a lot: **It's not anything new. Corrupt democracies have nothing to do with AGI**.

Which is... strictly true. The system is what needs to be aligned. It was the case before AI.

What I'm saying is that, full automation will set current inequalities in stone. 
2% of humans owning property over 90% of homes, lands, stuff; that was unfair before AI.

But AI will make that state of things unmovable.

What happens when you apply unlimited force against an unmovable object ?

## OK but, what to do from there ?

That's a great question, thanks for asking.

We formulate goals, and write agentic tools to achieve them.

And, if it's not achievable with tools, we break the goals down until it is.

### Endgoal

Humanity should, as a meta-individual, consciously ask for AGI labs to be responsible of creating the tools for pot-capitalism governance.

The Endgoal is for Altman, Demis Hassabis, (generally Anthropic, OpenAI and Deepmind) to be aware that alignment is about re-discussing the rules of reality. Make Ilya understand that Safe ASI" is not something that can exist as the same time as Capitalism
